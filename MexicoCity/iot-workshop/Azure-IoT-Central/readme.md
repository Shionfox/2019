## Tutorial: Connect MXChip Device to IoT Central

Now that you understand the basic concepts about a device template, we will import an existing template from the **Device Template library** and use it to connect a real MXChip device to Azure IoT Central.

### Create MXChip device template

1. Navigate to the **Device Templates** page.

2. To create a template, start by selecting **+New**.

3. Choose **MXChip** from the pre-built templates, and click **Create**.

   ![Device template library](images/devicetemplatelibrary.png)

> **Note:** When you create a device template, you will see the **Device Details** page for your new device template. IoT Central automatically creates a simulated device associated device template. A simulated device lets you test the behavior of your application before you connect a real device.

   **MXChip** device template has the following characteristics:

   * Telemetry which contains the measurements for the device **Humidity**, **Temperature**, **Pressure**, **Magnetometer** (measured along X, Y, Z axis), **Accelerometer** (measured along X, Y, Z axis) and **Gyroscope** (measured along X, Y, Z axis).
   * State which contains an example measurement for **Device State**.
   * Event measurement with a **Button B Pressed** event.
   * Settings showing **Voltage**, **Current**, **Fan Speed**, and an **IR** toggle.
   * Properties containing device property **die number** and **Device Location** which is a location property as well as in a **Manufactured In** cloud property.


4.	To add a new device, choose Device Explorer in the left navigation menu. The Device Explorer shows the MXChip device template and the simulated device that was automatically created when you created the device template.

5.	To start connecting a real MXChip, choose **+New**, then **Real**.

       * Enter the Device Id **<span style="color:Red">(should be lower case)</span>** or use the suggested Device Id.
       * Enter the Device Name or use the suggested name.
    
         ![Add Device](images/add-device.png)

6. Get connection details such as **Scope ID, Device ID, and Primary SAS key** for the added device by selecting **Connect** on the device page.

    ![Connection details](images/device-connect.png)

7. Make sure to save these details, as you will temporarily get disconnected from the internet as you prepare the DevKit device.

### Prepare the DevKit device

> **Note:** If you have previously used the device and have wifi credentials stored and would like to reconfigure the device to use a different WiFi network, connection string, or telemetry measurement, press both the **A** and **B** buttons on the board simultaneously. If it doesn't work, press **reset** button and try again.

#### To prepare the DevKit device

1. Download the latest pre-built Azure IoT Central firmware for the MXChip from the **releases** (https://aka.ms/iotcentral-docs-MXChip-releases) page on GitHub.
2. Connect the DevKit device to your development machine using a USB cable. In Windows, a file explorer window opens on a drive mapped to the storage on the DevKit device. For example, the drive might be called **AZ3166 (D:)**.
3. Drag the **iotCentral.bin** file onto the drive window. When the copying is complete, the device reboots with the new firmware.

1. When the DevKit device restarts, the following screen displays:

    ```
    Connect HotSpot:
    AZ3166_??????
    go-> 192.168.0.1
    PIN CODE xxxxx
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the screen displays anything else, reset the device and press the **A**  and **B** buttons on the device at the same time to reboot the device.

1. The device is now in access point (AP) mode. You can connect to this WiFi access point from your computer or mobile device.

1. On your computer, phone, or tablet connect to the WiFi network name shown on the screen of the device. When you connect to this network, you do not have internet access. This state is expected, and you are only connected to this network for a short time while you configure the device.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://192.168.0.1/start](http://192.168.0.1/start). The following web page displays:

    ![Device configuration page](images/configpage.png)

    In the web page: 
    - add the name of your WiFi network 
    - your WiFi network password
    - PIN CODE shown on the device LCD 
    - the connection details **Scope Id, Device Id, and Primary key** of your device (you should have already saved this following the steps)      
    - Select all the available telemetry measurements! 

> **Note:** You can connect to MSFTGuest or your phone's Hotspot 

1. After you choose **Configure Device**, you see this page:

    ![Device configured](images/deviceconfigured.png)

1. Press the **Reset** button on your device.


### View the telemetry

When the DevKit device restarts, the screen on the device shows:

* The number of telemetry messages sent.
* The number of failures.
* The number of desired properties received and the number of reported properties sent.

> **Note:** If the device appears to be looping during connect check if the device is *Blocked* in IoT Central, and *Unblock* the device so it can connect to the app.

Shake the device increment the number of reported properties sent. The device sends a random number as the **Die number** device property.

You can view the telemetry measurements and reported property values, and configure settings in Azure IoT Central:

1. Use **Device Explorer** to navigate to the **Measurements** page for the real MXChip device you added:

    ![Navigate to real device](images/realdevicenew.png)
